"""
This is a very simple script to show the basic instrumentation capabilities of Flowcept, using its most straightforward
way of capturing workflow provenance from functions: using @decorators. It is meant to be executed in offline model.

Flowcept will flush its internal buffer to a simple JSONL file in the end, if a `dump_buffer_path` is defined in
 the settings file (typically under ~/.flowcept/settings.yaml).

This very simple scenario does not need any database, streaming service, message queue or any other external service.
It should run fine after installing Flowcept via `pip install flowcept` and running `$> flowcept --init-settings`.

For more complex features, such as online provenance analysis, HPC requirements, federated/highly distributed execution,
 data observability from existing adapters, PyTorch models, telemetry capture optimization, query requirements, or
 any other provided feature or custom requirements, see the rest of examples/ directory and Flowcept docs.

Note:
- Adding output_names is not required, but they will make the generated provenance look nicer (and more semantic).
