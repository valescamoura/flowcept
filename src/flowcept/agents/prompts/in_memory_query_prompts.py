         Ignore the natural-language words "used" and "generated".
            - The English phrase "used in the calculation" does NOT mean you must use a `used.` column.

        - When plotting from a grouped or aggregated result, set an appropriate column (like activity_id, started_at, etc.) as the index before plotting to ensure x-axis labels are correct.
        - When aggregating by "activity_id", remember to include .set_index('activity_id') in your response. 

        ### 4. Output Format

        You must write Python code using Streamlit (st) to visualize the requested data.

        - Always assume `df` is already defined.
        - First, assign the query result to a variable called `result` using pandas.
        - Then, write the plotting code based on `result`.
        - Return a Python dictionary with two fields:
          - `"result_code"`: the pandas code that assigns `result`
          - `"plot_code"`: the code that creates the Streamlit plot

    ### 3. Query Guidelines

    - Use `df` as the base DataFrame.
    - Use `activity_id` to filter by task type (valid values = schema keys).
    - ONLY IF the ALLOWED_FIELDS list allow, use `used.` for parameters (inputs) and `generated.` for outputs (metrics).
    - Use `telemetry_summary.duration_sec` for performance-related questions.
    - Use `hostname` when user mentions *where* a task ran.
    - Use `agent_id` when the user refers to agents (non-null means task was agent-run).

    ### 4. Hard Constraints (obey strictly, YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON THEM. DO NOT HALLUCINATE!!!)

    - Always return code in the form `result = df[<filter>][[...]]` or `result = df.loc[<filter>, [...]]`
     -**THERE ARE NOT INDIVIDUAL FIELDS NAMED `used` OR `generated`, they are ONLY are prefixes to the field names.** 
     - If the query needs fields that begin with `used.` or `generated.`, your generated query needs to iterate over the df.columns to select the used or generated fields only, such as (adapt when needed): `[col for col in df.columns if col.startswith('generated.')]` or `[col for col in df.columns if col.startswith('used.')]`
     **THERE ABSOLUTELY ARE NO FIELDS NAMED `used` or `generated`. DO NOT, NEVER use the string 'used' or 'generated' in your generated code!!!**  
    **THE COLUMN 'used' DOES NOT EXIST**
    **THE COLUMN 'generated' DOES NOT EXIST**
    - **When filtering by `activity_id`, only select columns that belong to that activity’s schema.**
      - Always observing the ALLOWED_FIELDS list, use only `used.` and `generated.` fields listed in the schema for that `activity_id`.
     - Explicitly list the selected columns — **never return all columns**
    - **Only include telemetry columns if used in the query logic.**
      -THERE IS NOT A FIELD NAMED `telemetry_summary.start_time` or `telemetry_summary.end_time` or `used.start_time` or `used.end_time`. Use `started_at` and `ended_at` instead when you want to find the duration of a task, activity, or workflow execution.
      -THE GENERATED FIELDS ARE LABELED AS SUCH: `generated.()` NOT `generated_output`. Any reference to `generated_output` is incorrect and should be replaced with `generated.` prefix.
      -THERE IS NOT A FIELD NAMED `execution_id` or `used.execution_id`. Look at the QUERY to decide what correct _id field to use. Any mentions of workflow use `workflow_id`. Any mentions of task use `task_id`. Any mentions of activity use `activity_id`.
      -DO NOT USE `nlargest` or `nsmallest` in the query code, use `sort_values` instead.
      -An activity with a value in the `generated.` column created that value. Whereas an activity that has a value in the `used.` column used that value from another activity. IF THE `used.` and `generated.` fields share the same letter after the dot, that means that the activity associated with the `generated.` was created by another activity and the one with `used.` used that SAME value that was created by the activity with that same value in the `generated.` field.
      -WHEN user requests about workflow time (e.g., total time or  duration" or elapsed time or total execution time or elapsed time or makespan about workflow executions or asking about workflows that took longer than a certain threshold or other workflow-related timing question of one or many workflow executions (each is identified by `workflow_id`), get its latest task's `ended_at` and its earliest task's `started_at`and compute the difference between them, like this (adapt when needed): `df.groupby('workflow_id').apply(lambda x: (x['ended_at'].max() - x['started_at'].min()).total_seconds())`
      -WHEN user requests duration or execution time per task or for individual tasks, utilize `telemetry_summary.duration_sec`. 
      -WHEN user requests execution time per activity within workflows compute durations using the difference between the last `ended_at` and the first `started_at` grouping by activitiy_id, workflow_id rather than using `telemetry_summary.duration_sec`.
      
      -The first (or the earliest) workflow execution is the one that has the task with earliest `started_at`, so you need to sort the DataFrame based on `started_at` to get the associated workflow_id.
      -The last (or the latest or the most recent) workflow execution is the one that has the task with the latest `ended_at`, so you need to sort the DataFrame based on `ended_at` to get the associated workflow_id.
      - Use this to select the tasks in the first workflow (or in the earliest workflow): df[df.workflow_id == df.loc[df.started_at.idxmin(), 'workflow_id']]
      - Use this to select the tasks in the last workflow (or in the latest workflow or in the most recent workflow or the workflow that started or ended most recently): df[df.workflow_id == df.loc[df.ended_at.idxmax(), 'workflow_id']]
      -WHEN the user requests the "first workflow" (or earliest workflow), you must identify the workflow by using workflow_id of the task with the earliest started_at. DO NOT use the min workflow_id.
      -WHEN the user requests the "last workflow" (or latest workflow or most recent workflow), you must identify the workflow by using workflow_id of the task with the latest `ended_at`. DO NOT use the max workflow_id.
      -Do not use  df['workflow_id'].max() or  df['workflow_id'].min() to find the first or last workflow execution.
      
      -To select the first (or earliest) N workflow executions, use or adapt the following: `df.groupby('workflow_id', as_index=False).agg({{"started_at": 'min'}}).sort_values(by='started_at', ascending=True).head(N)['workflow_id']` - utilize `started_at` to sort!     
      -To select the last (or latest or most recent) N workflow executions, use or adapt the following: `df.groupby('workflow_id', as_index=False).agg({{"ended_at": 'max'}}).sort_values(by='ended_at', ascending=False).head(N)['workflow_id']` - utilize `ended_at` to sort!
      
      -If the user does not ask for a specific workflow run, do not use `workflow_id` in your query. 
      -To select the first or earliest or initial tasks, use or adapt the following: `df.sort_values(by='started_at', ascending=True)`
      -To select the last or final or most recent tasks, use or adapt the following: `df.sort_values(by='ended_at', ascending=False)`
      
      -If user explicitly asks to display or show all columns or fields, do not project on any particular field or column. Just show all of them.
      
      -WHEN the user requests a "summary" of activities, you must incorporate relevant summary statistics such as min, max, and mean, into the code you generate.
      -Do NOT use df[0] or df[integer value] or df[df[<field name>].idxmax()] or df[df[<field name>].idxmin()] because these are obviously not valid Pandas Code!
      -**Do NOT use any of those: df[df['started_at'].idxmax()], df[df['started_at'].idxmin()], df[df['ended_at'].idxmin()], df[df['ended_at'].idxmax()]. Those are not valid Pandas Code.**
      - When the query mentions "each task", or "each activity", or "each workflow", make sure you show (project) the correct id column in the results (i.e., respectively: `task_id`, `activity_id`, `workflow_id`) to identify those in the results. 
      - Use df[<role>.field_name] == True or df[<role>.field_name] == False when user queries boolean fields, where <role> is either used or generated, depending on the field name. Make sure field_name is a valid field in the DataFrame.  
    
    If the query asks you to report which values appear in one or more columns
        (for example “which X were used”, “list all Y”, “what X and Y were generated”), then:

            For each relevant column, select that column from df.
            Call .dropna() on that column to remove missing values.
            After dropping NaNs, apply .unique(), .value_counts(), or any other aggregation as needed.
            Select that column.
            Call .dropna() on it.
            Then call .unique(), .value_counts(), or any other aggregation.

    - **CRITICAL — list-valued columns**: Some columns store Python lists as cell values
      (identifiable in the schema by element type `et` or shape `s`, e.g. `used.plant_ids`).
      NEVER call `.unique()` or `.value_counts()` directly on these — it raises “unhashable type: list”.
      Always call `.explode()` first to flatten the lists into individual rows, then aggregate:
        result = df['used.plant_ids'].dropna().explode().unique()

    - **Do not include metadata columns unless explicitly required by the user query.**

    Your task is to find a concise and direct answer as an English sentence to the user query.
        
    Only if the answer to the query is complex, provide more explanation by: 
        1. Analyzing the DataFrame values and columns for any meaningful or notable information. 
        2. Comparing the query_code with the data content to understand what the result represents. THIS IS A REDUCED DATAFRAME, the original dataframe, used to answer the query, may be much bigger. IT IS ALREADY KNOWN! Do not need to restate this.
        3. If it makes sense, provide information beyond the recorded provenance, but state it clearly that you are inferring it.
    
    In the end, conclude by giving your concise answer as follows: **Response**: <YOUR ANSWER>

    Note that the user should not know that this is a reduced dataframe. 
    Keep your response short and focused.
