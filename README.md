# Quickstart

The easiest way to capture provenance from plain Python functions, with no external services needed:

1) Install and initialize settings

```shell
# Make sure you activate your Python environment (e.g., conda, venv) first
pip install flowcept
flowcept --init-settings
```
This generates a minimal settings file in `~/.flowcept/settings.yaml`.

2) Run the minimal example

Save the following script as `quickstart.py` and run `python quickstart.py.`

```python
"""
A minimal example of Flowcept's instrumentation using @decorators.
This example needs no DB, broker, or external service.
"""
from flowcept import Flowcept, flowcept_task
from flowcept.instrumentation.flowcept_decorator import flowcept


@flowcept_task(output_names="o1")
def sum_one(i1):
    return i1 + 1


@flowcept_task(output_names="o2")
def mult_two(o1):
    return o1 * 2


@flowcept
def main():
    n = 3
    o1 = sum_one(n)
    o2 = mult_two(o1)
    print("Final output", o2)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

    prov_messages = Flowcept.read_buffer_file()
    assert len(prov_messages) == 2
    print(f"Raw provenance captured: {len(prov_messages)} records in flowcept_messages.jsonl")
    Flowcept.generate_report(records=prov_messages, print_markdown=True)
```

This prints out:

Explore [Jupyter Notebooks](notebooks) and [Examples](examples) for usage.

## Installation

Flowcept can be installed in multiple ways, depending on your needs.

### 1. Default Installation
To install Flowcept with its basic dependencies from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/flowcept/), run:

```shell
pip install flowcept
```

This installs the minimal Flowcept package, **not** including MongoDB, Redis, MCP, or any adapter-specific dependencies.

### 2. Installing Specific Adapters and Additional Dependencies

Flowcept integrates with several tools and services, but you should **only install what you actually need**.  
Good practice is to cherry-pick the extras relevant to your workflow instead of installing them all.

```shell
pip install flowcept[mongo]         # MongoDB support
pip install flowcept[mlflow]        # MLflow adapter
pip install flowcept[dask]          # Dask adapter
pip install flowcept[tensorboard]   # TensorBoard adapter
pip install flowcept[kafka]         # Kafka message queue
pip install flowcept[nvidia]        # NVIDIA GPU runtime capture
pip install flowcept[amd]           # AMD GPU runtime capture (see "Install AMD GPU Lib" for version/LD_LIBRARY_PATH notes)
pip install flowcept[telemetry]     # CPU/GPU/memory telemetry capture
pip install flowcept[lmdb]          # LMDB lightweight database
pip install flowcept[mqtt]          # MQTT support
pip install flowcept[llm_agent]     # MCP agent, LangChain, Streamlit integration: needed either for MCP capture or for the Flowcept Agent.
pip install flowcept[llm_google]    # Google GenAI + Flowcept agent support
pip install flowcept[dev]           # Developer dependencies (docs, tests, lint, etc.)
```

### 3. Installing with Common Runtime Bundle

```shell
pip install flowcept[extras]
```

The `extras` group is a convenience shortcut that bundles the most common runtime dependencies.  
It is intended for users who want a fairly complete, but not maximal, Flowcept environment.

You might choose `flowcept[extras]` if:

- You want Flowcept to run out-of-the-box with Redis, telemetry, and MongoDB.  
- You prefer not to install each extra one by one

⚠️ If you only need one of these features, install it individually instead of `extras`.

### 4. Install All Optional Dependencies at Once

Flowcept provides a combined all extra, but installing everything into a single environment is not recommended for users.
Many of these dependencies are unrelated and should not be mixed in the same runtime. This option is only intended for Flowcept developers who need to test across all adapters and integrations.

```
pip install flowcept[all]
```

### 5. Installing from Source
To install Flowcept from the source repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ORNL/flowcept.git
cd flowcept
pip install .
```

You can then install specific dependencies similarly as above:

```
pip install .[optional_dependency_name]
```

This follows the same pattern as step 2, allowing for a customized installation from source.

## Setup

The [Quickstart](#quickstart) example works with just `pip install flowcept`, no extra setup is required.

For online queries or distributed capture, Flowcept relies on two optional components:

- **Message Queue (MQ)** — message broker / pub-sub / data stream  
- **Database (DB)** — persistent storage for historical queries  

---

#### Message Queue (MQ)

- Required for anything beyond Quickstart  
- Flowcept publishes provenance data to the MQ during workflow runs  
- Developers can subscribe with custom consumers (see [this example](examples/consumers/simple_consumer.py).  
- You can monitor or print messages in motion using `flowcept --stream-messages --print`.  

Supported MQs:
- [Redis](https://redis.io) → **default**, lightweight, works on Linux, macOS, Windows, and HPC (tested on [Frontier](link) and [Summit](link))  
- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) → for distributed environments or if Kafka is already in your stack  
- [Mofka](https://mofka.readthedocs.io) → optimized for HPC runs  

---

#### Database (DB)

- **Optional**, but required for:
  - Persisting provenance beyond MQ memory/disk buffers  
  - Running complex analytical queries on historical data  

Supported DBs:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) → default, efficient bulk writes + rich query support  
- [LMDB](https://lmdb.readthedocs.io) → lightweight, no external service, basic query capabilities  

---

### Notes

- Without a DB:
  - Provenance remains in the MQ only (persistence not guaranteed)  
  - Complex historical queries are unavailable  
- Flowcept’s architecture is modular: other MQs and DBs (graph, relational, etc.) can be added in the future  
- Deployment examples for MQ and DB are provided in the [deployment](deployment) directory  
 

### Downloading and Starting External Services (MQ or DB)

Flowcept uses external services for message queues (MQ) and databases (DB). You can start them with Docker Compose, plain containers, or directly on your host.

---

#### Using Docker Compose (recommended)

We provide a [Makefile](deployment/Makefile) with shortcuts:

1. **Redis only (no DB)**: `make services`   (LMDB can be used in this setup as a lightweight DB)
2. **Redis + MongoDB**: `make services-mongo`
3. **Kafka + MongoDB**: `make services-kafka`
4. **Mofka only (no DB)**: `make services-mofka`

To customize, edit the YAML files in [deployment](deployment/) and run `docker compose -f deployment/<compose-file>.yml up -d`

---

#### Using Docker (without Compose)

See the [deployment/](deployment/) compose files for expected images and configurations. You can adapt them to your environment and use standard `docker pull / run / exec` commands.

---

#### Running on the Host (no containers)

1. Install binaries for the service you need:  
   - **macOS** users can install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).  
     Example for Redis:
     ```bash
     brew install redis
     brew services start redis
     ```

   - On Linux, use your distro package manager (e.g. `apt`, `dnf`, `yum`) 
   - If non-root (typically the case if you want to deploy these services locally in an HPC system), search for the installed binaries for your OS/hardware architecture, download them in a directory that you have r+w permission, and run them.
   - On Windows, utilize [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to use a Linux distro.

2. Start services normally (`redis-server`, `mongod`, `kafka-server-start.sh`, etc.).

## Flowcept Settings File

Flowcept uses a settings file for configuration.

- To create a minimal settings file, run: `flowcept --init-settings` → creates `~/.flowcept/settings.yaml`

- To copy the full sample settings file, run: `flowcept --init-settings --full` → creates `~/.flowcept/settings.yaml`

- To switch runtime mode, apply a profile after creating the file:

```bash
flowcept --init-settings --full -y
flowcept --config-profile full-online -y
```

Meaning:

- `--init-settings` = minimal file with default settings.
- `--init-settings --full` = copy `resources/sample_settings.yaml`
- `--config-profile ...` = overlay a runtime mode on top of the existing file

---

#### What You Can Configure

- Message queue and database routes, ports, and paths  
- MCP agent ports and LLM API keys  
- Buffer sizes and flush settings  
- Telemetry capture settings  
- Instrumentation and PyTorch details  
- Log levels  
- Data observability adapters  
- And more (see [example file](resources/sample_settings.yaml))  

---

#### Custom Settings File

Flowcept looks for its settings in the following order:

1. Environment variable `FLOWCEPT_SETTINGS_PATH` — if set, Flowcept will use this path
2. `~/.flowcept/settings.yaml` — created by running `flowcept --init-settings`  
3. [Default sample file](resources/sample_settings.yaml) — used if neither of the above is found

Important:

- environment variables can override settings values
- use profiles for mode switches such as `full-online`, `full-offline`, `mq-only`, `mq-only-no-flush`, `full-telemetry`
- adapter flags are additive:

```bash
flowcept --init-settings --dask -y
flowcept --init-settings --mlflow -y
flowcept --init-settings --tensorboard -y
```

They add `adapters.<name>` to the current settings file instead of replacing the whole file.

# Examples

### Adapters and Notebooks

 See the [Jupyter Notebooks](notebooks) and [Examples directory](examples) for utilization examples.

## Workflow Cards

The [Quickstart](#quickstart) example (`python quickstart.py`) shows a workflow card.

Flowcept introduces the Workflow Card concept: a structured markdown summary of a workflow execution covering:

- **Summary** — workflow name, IDs, execution window, elapsed time, host, git info
- **Workflow-level Summary** — activity count, status counts, top slowest activities
- **Workflow Structure** — ASCII diagram of the activity DAG
- **Timing Report** — per-activity start, end, and median elapsed times with insights
- **Per Activity Details** — aggregated inputs (`used`) and outputs (`generated`) per activity
- **Per-activity Resource Usage** — CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, and GPU deltas (when telemetry is captured)
- **Object Artifacts Summary** — versioned artifacts produced or consumed by the workflow

Cards also support **campaign-level reporting** for multi-workflow runs (replicated experiments or multi-stage pipelines):

```python
# From a JSONL buffer file (no DB needed)
Flowcept.generate_report(input_jsonl_path="flowcept_messages.jsonl")

# From a live DB query
Flowcept.generate_report(workflow_id="<id>")
Flowcept.generate_report(campaign_id="<id>")

# As PDF
Flowcept.generate_report(workflow_id="<id>", report_type="provenance_report", format="pdf")
```

See [`docs/reporting.rst`](docs/reporting.rst) and [`src/flowcept/report/README.md`](src/flowcept/report/README.md) for the full reporting reference.

## Web UI

Flowcept ships a built-in web interface for browsing and analyzing provenance data. Start it with:

```bash
pip install flowcept[webservice]
flowcept --start-ui        # starts the webservice + dev server; open http://localhost:8008
```

Key features:
- **Provenance browser** — campaigns, workflows, tasks, and artifacts with drill-down views
- **Live updates** — SSE-based streaming so the task table updates while a workflow runs
- **Dashboards** — per-workflow and per-campaign chart dashboards (configurable, stored in MongoDB)
- **Dataflow graph** — W3C PROV-style graph of task inputs/outputs; click any node to inspect its provenance
- **LLM chat agent** — ask natural-language questions about your provenance data; charts render inline; queries are automatically scoped to the current workflow or campaign
- **Lineage highlighting** — ask the chat agent to highlight the full provenance lineage (ancestors + descendants) of any task directly in the Dataflow graph

The chat agent queries the **persisted store** (MongoDB) and the **live stream** (via near-real-time DB flushes from the MQ). For sub-second in-flight queries, use the MCP agent instead.

See [`docs/web_ui.rst`](docs/web_ui.rst) and [`ui/README.md`](ui/README.md) for the full reference.

See [example](examples/consumers/ping_pong_example.py).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Performance Tuning for Performance Evaluation

In the settings.yaml file, many variables may impact interception efficiency. 
Please be mindful of the following parameters:

* `mq`
    - `buffer_size` and `insertion_buffer_time_secs`. -- `buffer_size: 1` is really bad for performance, but it will give the most up-to-date info possible to the MQ.
    
* `log`
    - set both stream and files to disable

* `telemetry_capture` 
  The more things you enable, the more overhead you'll get. For GPU, you can turn on/off specific metrics.

* `instrumentation`
  This will configure whether every single granular step in the model training process will be captured. Disable very granular model inspection and try to use more lightweight methods. There are commented instructions in the settings.yaml sample file.

Other thing to consider:

```
project:
  replace_non_json_serializable: false # Here it will assume that all captured data are JSON serializable
  db_flush_mode: offline               # This disables the feature of runtime analysis in the database.
mq:
  chunk_size: -1                       # This disables chunking the messages to be sent to the MQ. Use this only if the main memory of the compute notes is large enough.
```

Other variables depending on the adapter may impact too. For instance, in Dask, timestamp creation by workers add interception overhead. As we evolve the software, other variables that impact overhead appear and we might not stated them in this README file yet. If you are doing extensive performance evaluation experiments using this software, please reach out to us (e.g., create an issue in the repository) for hints on how to reduce the overhead of our software.

## Install AMD GPU Lib

Only needed for AMD GPU telemetry capture. NVIDIA users use `flowcept[nvidia]` instead.

**Quick install:**
```bash
pip install flowcept[amd]
```

This installs the latest `amdsmi` from PyPI. The `amdsmi` Python package is a thin wrapper around the system's `libamd_smi.so`, so the PyPI version must match your ROCm installation. If you get a runtime error like `undefined symbol` or `libamd_smi.so not found`, follow the steps below.

**Matching the version to your ROCm:**

1. Find your ROCm version:
   ```bash
   ls /opt/rocm-*   # e.g. /opt/rocm-6.2.4
   # or: rocm-smi --version
   ```

2. Find the matching `amdsmi` PyPI version — the major/minor version tracks ROCm (e.g. ROCm 6.2.x → `amdsmi==6.2.*`, ROCm 7.0.x → `amdsmi==7.0.*`):
   ```bash
   pip index versions amdsmi   # lists all available versions
   pip install amdsmi==<X.Y.Z>
   ```

3. Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so Python finds the correct shared library:
   ```bash
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/rocm-<X.Y.Z>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```
   Add this to your job script or shell profile so it persists.

**Verify:**
```bash
python -c "from amdsmi import amdsmi_init, amdsmi_get_processor_handles; amdsmi_init(); print(len(amdsmi_get_processor_handles()), 'GPU(s) found')"
```

## Torch Dependencies

Some unit tests utilize `torch==2.2.2`, `torchtext=0.17.2`, and `torchvision==0.17.2`. They are only really needed to run some tests and will be installed if you run `pip install flowcept[ml_dev]` or `pip install flowcept[all]`. If you want to use Flowcept with Torch, please adapt torch dependencies according to your project's dependencies.
